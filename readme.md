# [appinator](#)

A simple utility for generating osx bundles (_commonly known as a `.app`_).


## sales pitch

_Sometimes you just want an executable that doesn't leave a terminal window open._  While this case may be rare for go (since there is no native windowing toolkit, yet), this tool is agnostic to the application it is wrapping.

This utility is written to work cross-platform, allowing you to build bundles for distribution from anywhere (a convenience given go's cross-platform compilation capabilities).

There are no tests, but as a goal for all of my projects should be understandable at-a-glance.
